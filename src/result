/* TESTING SPUDD */
| x2 | x4 |
| x1 | x3 |
actions: 0, 1, 2, 3 (top, right, bottom, left). reward at x4 is 1
get utility at x2

V0: (left: true, right, false)
    x4
1       0

V1: comes out to be 0.9 for x2. output diagram:
    x4
1.9     0.9
Since x4 is false, and x2 is true it comes out to be 0.9.
Currently implemented using integers so output is 2 (true) and 1 (false).
